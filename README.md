# tetris-game
This is my tetris game implementation using vanilla Javascript.

### Tetris Rules:
These are the following rules:
- Added shifting rule when close to the wall while rotating.
- The tetromino bag to maintain easy teris line clear for user.
- Auto drop speed increases as the level increase.

### TODOS
- [ ] Create User Interface
- [ ] Implement a better score and leveling system
- [X] Implement Tetromino holder
- [X] Implement proper random tetromino generator (tetromino bag)
- [ ] Display upcoming tetrominoes
- [X] Display top 5 user high score
- [X] Display Game Over Screen

### BUGS to fix
- Fix locked tetromino when pressing key against the wall/locked tetromino
- Remove tetromino color trail
- Displayed tetrominoes copying current pattern when hold
