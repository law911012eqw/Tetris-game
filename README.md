# tetris-game
This is my tetris game implementation using vanilla Javascript.

### Tetris Rules:
These are the following rules:
- Added shifting rule when close to the wall while rotating.
- The tetromino bag to maintain easy teris line clear for user.
- Auto drop speed increases as the level increase.

### TODOS
- [X] Create User Interface
- [X] Implement a better score and leveling system
- [X] Implement Tetromino holder
- [X] Implement proper random tetromino generator (tetromino bag)
- [X] Display upcoming tetrominoes
- [X] Display top 5 user high score
- [X] Display Game Over Screen

### BUGS to fix
- Sometimes current piece is slowly generated
- Fix key binding/behavior and clunky movements
